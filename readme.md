ChatBot is a bare minimal code, needed to access OpenAI's GTP-3 as a ChatBot. GPT-3 is a large language model, which can be used as a ChatBot if implemented correctly. This project allows the users to chat with GPT-3 as a chatbot once they enter their API access key, which is not free. You can sign up for a trial. The trial will allow you to use all the features of GPT-3 upto $18. Once you reach the $18, you will then need to pay for more credits.  This chatbot is implemented using python 3, the user can add their API key in line 4 of chatbot.py, inside quotation marks.  EX: openai.api_key= "Your_Key_Here".
